# finance
The goal was to implement a web-based tool that allows users to sign in in order to manage portfolios of stocks.
Users can check real stocks' actual prices and portfolios' values (using Yahoo Finance), they can also also buy and sell stocks!

The tool is implemented using the MVC pattern and was the opportunity to improve my HTML and CSS skills as well as MySQL understanding.
